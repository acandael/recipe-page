## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This exercise was more difficult then it looked at first. Especially the ordered list with custom digital bullets was quite advanced.

### Continued development

My latest projects were all using Tailwind, so I used touched with CSS a bit. So I would love to dive deeper in modern CSS and the latest additions to the language.

Other areas I would like to involve in are web accessibility.
